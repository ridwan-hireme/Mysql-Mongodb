MySQL and MongoDB are both popular database systems, but they differ significantly in their approach to data referencing. Let's compare the two in relation to data referencing with some examples:

**MySQL (Relational Database):**
MySQL is a traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses structured tables with predefined schemas and enforces strong data consistency and integrity. In MySQL, data referencing is achieved through primary and foreign key relationships.

Example:
Consider a scenario where we have two tables, `users` and `orders`, where each order is associated with a specific user.

```sql
-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Orders Table
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_number VARCHAR(10),
  user_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

In this example, the `user_id` column in the `orders` table is a foreign key that references the `id` column in the `users` table. This establishes a relationship between the two tables, ensuring data integrity and referential integrity.

**MongoDB (NoSQL Document Database):**
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). MongoDB does not enforce strict schemas or predefined relationships, providing more flexibility in data modeling. Data referencing in MongoDB is typically achieved through embedded documents or manual references.

Example:
Using the same scenario as before, let's see how data referencing can be handled in MongoDB.

```javascript
// Users Collection
{
  "_id": ObjectId("61234ef6c63a4a98b7a8b1f1"),
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}

// Orders Collection
{
  "_id": ObjectId("61234ef6c63a4a98b7a8b1f2"),
  "order_number": "ORD001",
  "user": {
    "_id": ObjectId("61234ef6c63a4a98b7a8b1f1"),
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
}
```

In MongoDB, you can choose to embed the user document within the order document or manually reference the user document using the `_id` field. Embedding can be beneficial when the related data is accessed together, while manual referencing allows for more flexibility and scalability.

MongoDB's flexible data model makes it possible to denormalize data and avoid costly joins, improving query performance in certain use cases.

Overall, the choice between MySQL and MongoDB for data referencing depends on factors such as data structure complexity, scalability needs, performance requirements, and the level of flexibility desired in your application's data model. MySQL's relational model excels in structured data with well-defined relationships, while MongoDB's document model provides more flexibility for unstructured or evolving data schemas.
